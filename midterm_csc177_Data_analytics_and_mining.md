# Midterm: CSC177 Data Analytics and Mining - SECTION 02

- Due Oct 30 at 11:59pm
- Points 100
- Questions 19
- Available Oct 22 at 12am - Nov 24 at 11:59pm
- Time Limit None

## Instructions

Dear students,

Answer all questions.Â  You are required to work individually on the midterm.
There is no time limit until the due date.

As it is an individual exam, you are (strictly) not allowed to consult with anyone.
Also, if you require any clarification(s) on any question, you must consult
with the instructor and not another student. Any collaboration will be viewed
strictly -- honoring the university honor code is paramount!

You can step in and out of Canvas midterm without hitting the submit button,
since Canvas saves your previous answers. However, once you hit the submit
button, it is final, Canvas will not let you edit your answers.

You have time until the due date.

All questions in this quiz are open book, open notes. You are allowed to search
the internet and consult the python tutorial code.

Enjoy!

Cheers,

:)

### Midterm questions

#### Question 01 - 3 pts

- [ ] order is not preserved
- [ ] data is continuous
- [ ] order is preserved

possible noise and ...

#### Question 14 - 10 pts

Explain your understanding of the equation:

$R^2\:=\:\frac{SSR}{SST}=1\:-\:\frac{SSE}{SST}$

What does $R^2$ (R-squared) describe?

[Statistics By Jim - How To Interpret R-squared in Regression Analysis](https://statisticsbyjim.com/regression/interpret-r-squared-regression/)

In your summary display your intuition by explaining in your own words.
Points will be awarded for originality in explaining the summary in your own
words. Zero points will be awarded if your summary is not in your own words.

#### Question 15 - 10 pts

Given the dataset of cars with their mileage and cost for the cost production:

Build a decision tree and attach the picture of your decision tree formed as the
solution to the questioning using hints from tutorial_6.

- What do you think is special about the data type of the values predicted
  in this problem?
- Do a search and find out why a DecisionTreeRegressor is used in this case
  (instead of the general purpose DecisionTreeClassifier)?

Both examples are in the tutorial code.

```python
array(
    [
        ['Toyota Corolla', '40', '20175'],
        ['Ford', '45', '25000'],
        ['Dodge', '62', '35782'],
        ['Chevrolet', '50', '30000'],
        ['Canoo', '57', '34750'],
        ['Tesla', '113', '54000'],
        ['BMW', '70', '36400']
    ],
    dtype='<U21'
)
```

#### Question 16 - 10 pts


From the given dataset find the

- mean
- standard deviation
- 25% - the 25% percentile
- 50% - the 50% percentile
- 75% - the 75% percentile

for the 'Math' and 'English' attribute.

```python
dictionary_data = {
    'Name': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'],
    'Math': [87, 90, 51, 25, 98],
    'English': [50, 68, 45, 88, 14]
}

dataframe = pandas.DataFrame(dictionary_data)
```

#### Question 17 - 10 pts

Explain Lasso and Ridge Regression. Compare and Contrast Lasso and Ridge Regression.

#### Question 18

You are given a small dataset with **x** as an independent variable and **y**
as dependent on **x**

**x**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

**y**: 3, 4, 2, 4, 5

Find the best fit line for the above.

**Assumption**: Take the mean of the values for features as the initial point

**Hint**: Use the R-squared method.

Note: Show the calculations and answer the equation of the best fit line.

#### Question 19 - 6 pts

You have a dataset of heights and weights of 100 people. The dataset contains
missing values and outliers that need to be removed as a pre-processing step.

The mean height is 170 cm, and the mean weight is 70 kg. However, 10 observation
are missing the value of height, and 5 observation are missing the weight
variable. You want to impute the missing values using the main of the
non-missing observations.

Write a one-line answer for: Why is imputing a value important in this case?

What are imputed values for the missing heights and weights?
